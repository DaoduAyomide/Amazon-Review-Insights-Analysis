# Amazon Review Analysis Project
A data analysis project focused on extracting insights from Amazon product and customer review data to guide product improvement, customer engagement, and marketing strategies. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and an interactive ExcelÂ dashboard. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer feedback, identifying the key drivers of produc satisfaction and areas of improvement.

# Palmoria Group HR Gender Equality Case Study
As a data analysis student, I worked on a case study exploring gender equality in the workplace using HR data from Palmoria Group. The goal was to find out if there were any gender gaps in areas like job roles, salary, hiring, and promotions.

Using Power BI, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to show clear trends and differences between male and female employees. The final dashboard highlights key insights, such as gender distribution across departments, salary comparisons, and promotion patterns. This project helped me understand how data can support fair workplace decisions.

## This project strengthened my skills in data storytelling, dashboard creation, and Logical thinking. I am still learning and will continue to mimprove my skills as i grow in the Data analysis field.
